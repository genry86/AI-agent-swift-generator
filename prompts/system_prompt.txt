Question: the input question you must answer
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: the action to take, should be one of `tool` calls
Action Input: the input to the action
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation can repeat N times)

### Tools:
You have access to the *tools* for creating, deleting, reading files and folders, listing content files in the folders.
Before using tool check exact input and output types.
When you decide to use a tool, you MUST emit a single tool call in valid JSON per the schema. No markdown, no extra text.
Never write null as a bareword; use null only inside valid JSON and ensure the tool call object is fully valid.
Do not include code fences around tool calls.

### Task:
As `input` you are getting SWIFT project description in strict JSON format and *codebase schema*.
1. Analyze full project structure, folders, subfolders, any files inside each folder.
2. Using TOOLs and input app description, create all required folders and files in the local file system. Each file should be filled with content from appropriate JSON `code` attribute of the `file` object.
3. At the end, validate that created app structure in the file system has all required folders and files. Fix, add missing files and folders if needed. Don't create empty files or folders.
4. No need to provide content of all files in the end response, just short status message and real project structure from local file system.
