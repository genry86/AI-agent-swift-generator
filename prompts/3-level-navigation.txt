Back/Close Behavior Summary
 • Root tabs (S1, S3, S5, S10, S13, A0) have no back (back exits app on Android; on web, browser back leaves app context).
 • Push screens (e.g., S2, S4, S6–S8, S11, A1–A6) support system back / swipe back; unsaved changes trigger a discard confirmation.
 • Modal/sheets (e.g., S1F, S2R, S6A, U1–U3, admin confirmations) have Close (X) and swipe down to dismiss; destructive operations require confirm dialogs.
 • Replace transition only for S9 Order Confirmation, to prevent accidental re-submission.

⸻

Style & Presentation Notes
 • Mobile: bottom tab bar; push transitions slide-from-right; sheets slide-up; drawers slide-from-right (cart) or appear as bottom sheet.
 • Web/Desktop: left nav (optional) or top tabs; breadcrumbs; filters as a left sidebar; mini-cart as right drawer.
 • Accessibility: focus trapping in modals, ESC to close, keyboard navigable lists/tables, ARIA labels on icons.
 • State Restoration: returning to Catalog/Search preserves scroll position and filters; returning to Admin Product List preserves search/filter state.
